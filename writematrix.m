function writematrix(A, filename, varargin)
%WRITEMATRIX Write a matrix to a file.
%
%   WRITEMATRIX(A) writes the homogenous array A to a comma-delimited text
%   file. The file name is the workspace name of the homogenous array A,
%   appended with ".txt".
%
%   If WRITEMATRIX cannot construct the file name from the homogenous array
%   input, it writes to the file "matrix.txt".
%
%   WRITEMATRIX overwrites any existing file by default, but this behavior
%   can be changed to append or error using the "WriteMode" name-value pair.
%
%   WRITEMATRIX(A, FILENAME) writes the homogenous array A to the file
%   FILENAME as column-oriented data. WRITEMATRIX determines the file
%   format from its extension. The extension must be one of those listed
%   below.
%
%   WRITEMATRIX(A, FILENAME, "FileType", FILETYPE) specifies the file type,
%   where FILETYPE is one of "text" or "spreadsheet".
%
%   WRITEMATRIX writes data to different file types as follows:
%
%   Delimited text files:
%   ---------------------
%
%   The following extensions are recognized: .txt, .dat, .csv, .log,
%                                            .text, .dlm
%
%   WRITEMATRIX creates a column-oriented text file, i.e., each
%   column of each variable in A is written out as a column in the
%   file.
%
%   Use the following optional parameter name/value pairs to control
%   how data are written to a delimited text file:
%
%   "Delimiter"    - The delimiter used in the file. Can be any of " ",
%                    "\t", ",", ";", "|" or their corresponding names "space",
%                    "tab", "comma", "semi", or "bar". Default is ",".
%
%   "QuoteStrings" - A logical value that specifies whether to write
%                    text out enclosed in double quotes ("..."). If
%                    "QuoteStrings" is true, any double quote characters that
%                    appear as part of a text variable are replaced by two
%                    double quote characters.
%
%   "DateLocale"   - The locale that WRITEMATRIX uses to create month and
%                    day names when writing datetimes to the file. LOCALE must
%                    be a character vector or scalar string in the form xx_YY.
%                    See the documentation for DATETIME for more information.
%
%   "Encoding"     - The encoding to use when creating the file.
%                    The default value is "UTF-8".
%
%   "WriteMode"    - Append to an existing file or overwrite an
%                    existing file:
%                    - "overwrite" - Overwrite the file, if it
%                                    exists. This is the default option.
%                    - "append"    - Append to the bottom of the file,
%                                    if it exists.
%
%   Spreadsheet files:
%   ------------------
%
%   The following extensions are recognized: .xls, .xlsx, .xlsb, .xlsm,
%                                            .xltx, .xltm
%
%   WRITEMATRIX creates a column-oriented spreadsheet file, i.e., each column
%   of each variable in A is written out as a column in the file.
%
%   Use the following optional parameter name/value pairs to control how data
%   are written to a spreadsheet file:
%
%   "DateLocale"     - The locale that writematrix uses to create month and day
%                      names when writing datetimes to the file. LOCALE must be
%                      a character vector or scalar string in the form xx_YY.
%                      Note: The "DateLocale" parameter value is ignored
%                      whenever dates can be written as Excel-formatted dates.
%
%   "Sheet"          - The sheet to write, specified the worksheet name, or a
%                      positive integer indicating the worksheet index.
%
%   "Range"          - A character vector or scalar string that specifies a
%                      rectangular portion of the worksheet to write, using the
%                      Excel A1 reference style.
%
%   "UseExcel"       - A logical value that specifies whether or not to create the
%                      spreadsheet file using Microsoft(R) Excel(R) for Windows(R).
%                      Set "UseExcel" to one of these values:
%                      - false - Does not open an instance of Microsoft Excel
%                                to write the file. This is the default setting.
%                                This setting may cause the data to be
%                                written differently for files with
%                                live updates (e.g. formula evaluation or plugins).
%                      - true  - Opens an instance of Microsoft Excel to write 
%                                the file on a Windows system with Excel installed.
%
%   "WriteMode"      - Perform an in-place write, append to an existing
%                      file or sheet, overwrite an existing file or
%                      sheet.
%                      - "inplace"        - In-place replacement of
%                                           the data in the sheet.
%                                           This is the default
%                                           option.
%                      - "overwritesheet" - If sheet exists,
%                                           overwrite contents of sheet.
%                      - "replacefile"    - Create a new file. Prior
%                                           contents of the file and 
%                                           all the sheets are removed.
%                      - "append"         - Append to the bottom of
%                                           the occupied range within
%                                           the sheet.
%
%   "AutoFitWidth"   - A logical value that specifies whether or not to change
%                      column width to automatically fit the contents. Defaults to true.
%
%   "PreserveFormat" - A logical value that specifies whether or not to preserve
%                      existing cell formatting. Defaults to true.
%
%   In some cases, WRITEMATRIX creates a file that does not represent A
%   exactly, as described below. If you use READMATRIX(FILENAME) to read that
%   file back in and create a new matrix, the result may not have exactly
%   the same format or contents as the original matrix.
%
%   *  WRITEMATRIX writes out numeric data using long g format, and
%      categorical or character data as unquoted text.
%   *  WRITEMATRIX writes out arrays that have more than two dimensions as two
%      dimensional arrays, with trailing dimensions collapsed.
